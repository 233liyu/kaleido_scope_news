            "content": " (CNN) South Korea may be known for its sharp focus on the new, but architects    and their increasingly sophisticated clients    are looking to the past for inspiration. Once a familiar sight across the country, traditional Korean houses, called hanoks, have been steadily disappearing since the 1990s.  Despite government efforts to preserve them, these   courtyard homes have been replaced by modern housing, or destroyed to make way for large commercial developments and infrastructure. But just as   grew from Korea’s musical past to express newfound wealth and national identity, ’ ’ is now offering a contemporary take on traditional living. ”Historically, the prevalent view was that the hanok was useless    it was blocking development and economic progress,” says Hyumgmin Pai, an architectural historian at Seoul National University who curated South Korea’s   pavilion at the 2014 Venice Biennale.  ”Now we are just beginning to understand what hanoks mean.” Evolving for the 21st century, At first glance, the wildly creative homes being built in today’s South Korea appear anything but  . Their sleek lines and glossy exteriors reflect a modern aesthetic that many Koreans aspire to. But look closely and you find that many of the country’s most inventive architects are drawing on hanok principles.  Featuring conventional layouts and traditional building materials, a new aesthetic is emerging in Korean architecture, explains Doojin Hwang, a   architect and author of ”Hanok is Back,” a book on hanok restoration. Read: Why North Korea’s capital is the ’perfect science fiction film set’ ”There is a renewed interest in applying lessons from traditional architecture to modern and contemporary buildings,” Hwang says.  ”In the old days, that normally meant a very direct application of [traditional] stylistic elements to modern buildings. Now, architects are more interested in a process of ’critical reinterpretation’    and applying that principle to a modern building.” Read: Saving China’s abandoned Tulou homes, Leading Advocates, Hanok design reflects the Asian way of living ”very close to the floor,” says Pai. In Japan, this principle meant the widespread use of tatami    floor mats made from rice straw. But hanoks come with a distinctive Korean design feature: a heated floor. And while internal courtyards are found across Asian architecture, in Korea they were considered   spaces of ”production and community,” says Pai, who is   the first Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism this fall. This makes them quite different from Japanese courtyards, which were landscaped as gardens to relax in. The close relationship between a building’s interior and its exterior is another design principle that today’s architects are hoping to revive. ”As [South Koreans] became more and more modernized, for some reason we started to think that everyday life should take place inside the house,” explains Hwang, who has used his experience renovating hanoks to inspire contemporary designs.  ”What’s happening these days is something I call ’rediscovery of the exterior. ’” Read: Why these extraordinary Cambodian buildings need to be saved,   architect Moon Hoon also draws on hanok design principles, though his colorful and creative buildings have attracted ire from some critics in South Korea. Hoon says that traditional influences are clear in his use of geometric angles, open space, pavilions and even the way he positions his projects on the land. Not everyone sees it that way. ”Many architects in Korea think that I’m an alien,” Hoon says. ”It tends to only be people from overseas who see that relationship with traditional Korean architecture. So that’s really a paradox.” Changing tides, The popularity of traditional designs marks a significant shift in a society defined by modernity. Having completely rebuilt the country from the ashes of Japanese occupation and war, many South Korean consumers see newness as a marker of success. Read: Understanding Japan’s unique ’scrap and build’ design culture, But as the country grows more comfortable with its identity, architects say that people are learning to appreciate the beauty and grace of the past. ”I think hanok [design] has been an inspiration for architects all along, but recently this has [reached] the general public,” says Hoon. ”They have become appreciative of our heritage.” Read: The ’prefab’ housing resurgence rolls on, Local designers also have one eye on the future. Many have been enhancing their buildings’ ecological credentials through the design principles that made hanoks   to Korea’s temperate climate. ”Hanoks are easy to cool in the summer because of the courtyard, and easy to heat in the winter because the rooms are small,” says Robert Fouser, an American professor and   of the 2015 book ”Hanok: The Korean House.” Nonetheless, architects still need to find new ways of adapting hanoks to the 21st century.  David Kilburn, a   British expatriate who has lived in traditional homes and campaigned for their preservation for more than twenty years, notes that hanoks are ”in many ways not well suited to a consumerist world where you have a lot of possessions, a lot of clothes and a lot of household accessories.”   Read: Lotte World Tower opens in Seoul setting world records, And Hoon argues that hanok design needs to help people feel more connected to the natural world. ”The awakening of the general public [to traditional design] is cultivating clients who understand the value of a hanok and its capacity to be in harmony with nature,” he says, ”of it being more than a mere pretty object standing alone in the environment.”  ",

Actually, it’s harsher than that. In Kalanick’s world, the   losers don’t get to play the game anymore. ” ”   The result has been a near monopoly, but a costly one: Uber is   losing vast amounts of money to retain its position and the   dominant player in  . But Lyft, stubbornly, isn’t   going away and can’t seem to be spent out of existence.  ” ”   Columbia Business School professor Evan Rawley  that this means the best Uber can hope for is   to become the leader of an oligopoly  —   a troubling proposition,   given Uber’s lofty valuation, the need for investors to get a   payout at some point, and the ongoing cost of being the biggest. ” ’  ’ ”   Dealing with this challenge is going to require far more   technocratic leadership that what Kalanick can provide, and   that’s why the Uber board has been looking for a Chief Operating   Officer to transition the company from being a scrappy street   fighter to a mature corporation whose practices won’t freak out   conservative institutional investors. ” ”   As a practical matter, getting rid of Kalanick is difficult due   to Uber’s compliant board and his equity power over the company  —     like most founders in Silicon Valley, he’s rigged his shares so   that his vote counts for far more than everybody else’s.  ” ”   But Kalanick could, and I stress this, be a   person of more complicated character than Uber’s early narrative   would indicate. He’s clearly smart, and he’s clearly not devoid   of conscience, as his resignation from President Trump’s advisory   council amid protests over the administration’s failed travel ban   indicated. We shouldn’t be so cynical to assume that a hard and   damaged man can’t reinvent himself. There are second acts in   American life. ” ’   Which isn’’t to say that we should accept this whole ”Travis 2. 0”   thing, oozing as it does with Silicon Valley privilege, at face   value. Travis 2. 0 could have a higher and better future, but   maybe it isn’’t with Uber 2. 0. The worst case scenario is   obviously that Travis 2. 0 returns to Uber with revenge on his   agenda.  ’ ’  ’ ’   Early on, I liked Uber and was an avid customer. But Kalanick’’s      approach to business always rankled me, and the   swiftness by which ”Uber” became a favored verb, a signal of   one’’s hipness to the disruption, was disturbing. This was, after   all, a company that seemed to enjoy skirting laws and making   life hard for its drivers. ’ ’   Living in the New York area, I went back to yellow cabs. Part of   this was practical  —   raising my hand to get a ride is easier than   fumbling with a phone. But part of it was also the result of how   Kalanickism had suffused Uber. I figured I had to take a stand,   and so I switched over to Lyft in case I needed a backup for     taxis. ’ ”   None of this had anything to do with the evidently toxic   workplace culture that Uber engendered, but I’m not surprised   that the company’s crisis has revealed a morass of sexism, bad   behavior, and exploitative business practices in need   of immediate remedy. The bottom line is that I just had a   bad feeling about Uber than I couldn’t shake. ” ”   What Kalanick’s leave proves is that even with Silicon Valley   startups, there’s a moral element to how we   interact with  —   and, as journalists, cover  —       enterprises. They don’t get a pass because a large part of their   mandate is to obliterate and dynamically replace the old ways of   doing things. In fact, they need to rise to a higher level of   ethical scrutiny due to the heavy amount of destruction that’s   baked into their DNA. ” ”   It’s difficult to not be dazzled by the billions. But you still   have to look at yourself in the mirror every morning. ” ’•Kalanick now needs to put his life ahead of. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’",

            "content": "’  ’ ”   There was a lot Jeff Sessions couldn’t quite guarantee Tuesday. ” ’   The attorney general  in his blockbuster hearing   that he couldn’’t ”recall” a particular detail. That was in   addition to eight instances in which he did not ”know” the   answer to a question posed by a member of the panel, five   instances in which he did not ”believe,” four times he did   not ”think,” and twice each that he did not ”have” or ”remember”   what the senator in question was looking for. ’ ”   So naturally, the most important takeaway  was not  it’s   what he did not say. ” ”   On several occassions, Sessions refused to answer questions   related to his private conversations with President Donald Trump,   including conversations about FBI Director James Comey’s   firing, the possibility of presidential pardons for Trump   associates, and whether Trump had expressed frustration with   Sessions’   recusal from any   investigations involving the Trump campaign. If these   conversations did occur, they could be central to a possible      case. ” ’   Sessions’’ rationale for his refusal to detail such conversations   was his ”duty to protect confidential communications” he’’s had   with the president and a ”longstanding Department of Justice   practice” not to disclose such information.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and   National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers gave similar   explanations before the Senate Intelligence Committee. ’ ’   Several senators zeroed in on that explanation  —   Democratic Sens.   Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Kamala Harris of California and   Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine  —   in their lines of   questioning, hammering the attorney general on the legitimacy of   his rationale. The center of their argument was simple: the   president had not invoked executive privilege, Sessions could not   on his own invoke executive privilege, so how could Sessions not   answer the questions? ’ ’   ”You’’re impeding this investigation,” Heinrich said. ”So my   understanding of the legal standard is that you either answer the   question. That’’s the best outcome. You say this is classified,   can’’t answer it here. I’’ll answer it in closed session. That’’s   bucket number two. Bucket number three is to say ’’I’’m invoking   executive privilege. ’’ There is no appropriateness bucket. It is   not a legal standard.” ’ ”   Sessions said it would be inappropriate to do so without giving   Trump the chance to review whether he wanted to invoke executive   privilege, a position that a number of legal experts told   Business Insider would not pass muster if Congress really wanted   to push the White House. And when pressed on the specifics of the   Justice Department policy he was citing to sidestep some of the   senators’ questions, Sessions could not answer much at all. ” ’   ”Can you tell me what are these   DOJ rules that   protect conversations made in the executive without invoking   executive privilege?” Heinrich asked, later repeating the   question a second time. ”Can you share those policies with us?   Are they written down at the Department of Justice?” ’ ’   ”I believe they are,” Sessions responded. ’ ’   Sessions could not, however, detail the particulars of the   supposed DOJ policy he was referring to. ’ ’   Harris asked about the   policy, which Sessions   said ”goes beyond just the attorney general.” ’ ’   ”Is that policy in writing somewhere?” Harris asked. ’ ’   ”I think so,” Sessions repsonded. ’ ’  ’ ’   Legal experts who spoke to Business Insider said Sessions has   essentially invented a ”brand new privilege” and, if the   administration is able to have its officials continue to use this   rationale during testimony, it would lead to a code of ”executive   silence.” ’ ’   ”Sessions’’ rationale was completely lacking in any legal basis,”   Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA, told Business Insider in   an email. ’ ’   ”There are privileges, such as executive privilege and the   privilege against   but Sessions was clear that   he was not invoking these well established rights,” he continued.   ”Instead, he was asserting some brand new privilege of his own   invention, with no legal support whatsoever. The question is when   will Republicans in Congress stand up to the president and stop   this lawlessness.” ’ ’   Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor and a     of the Lawfare blog, said he was unsure of what   Sessions ”has in mind” with his explanation. ’ ’   ”Barring a claim of executive privilege, it’’s unclear how any   mere departmental policy position would cut any ice when Congress   seeks testimony from an executive branch official,” he told   Business Insider in an email. ’ ”   Congress’ options in this matter are simple, experts said. ” ”   Congress can subpoena Sessions to answer the questions members   laid out. That would essentially force the White House’s hand to   either invoke executive privilege, and possibly go to court over   whether the invocation was proper, or decide against invoking   privilege, in which case Sessions could be held in   contempt of Congress if he chose not to answer. ” ’   Democrats such as Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Adam Schiff   of California have already started homing in on that strategy   following the testimony. ’ ’   Republican Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence   Committee, concluded the hearing by asking Sessions if he could   ”go back and work with the White House” to see if he can provide   answers to any questions to the committee in writing ”if there   are any areas of questions that they feel comfortable with you   answering,” which is far from signaling the potential for a   subpoena. ’ ’   As Alan Dershowitz, the renowned attorney and professor emeritus   at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider in an email,   Congress ”can compel” Sessions to answer the questions and   override any Justice Department policy, so long as privilege has   not been invoked. He added that Trump would have to invoke   executive privilege if Congress were to subpoena Sessions for the   questions. ’ ’   But Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said he   believes ”it’’s too late” for Trump to invoke executive privilege,   adding that he would argue Trump has already waived his right to   invoke. ’ ’   ”Because President Trump was on notice for all of these questions   when Comey appeared,” he told Business Insider. ”President Trump   failed to invoke the privilege in time for Comey. I could make   arguments that he waived it anyway. The fact is that President   Trump was on ample and obvious notice for all of these questions   Sessions was asked. And by failing to invoke it before 2:30 p. m.   he has permanently waived his privilege on these questions. So   you can’’t go back, you can unring the bell.” ’ ’   ”The rationale that it could be invoked at any time, it can be   invoked unilaterally by the official without the president” is an   improper reading of executive privilege doctrine, he said, adding   that Sessions was ”incoherent” and had ”no arguments” to defend   his refusal to answer. ’ ’   ”He had ample time to prepare for this, and he was incoherent,   and he did not give competent answers to the legal questions that   everyone knew he would have,” Shugerman said. ’ ’  ’ ’   Citing the exchanges with King, Harris, and Heinrich, Shugerman   said Sessions had ”exposed” himself by failing to give ”effective   answers” to explain his position. ’ ’   ”What’’s really was stunning was it’’s obvious that this question   was going to be one of the central questions of today’’s   hearings,” he said. ”And so for the attorney general to appear   and talk about DOJ policy in this completely ambiguous way,   completely opened himself up to Kamala Harris’’ excellent   questions.” ’ ’   ”The idea that executive privilege exists out there in a floating   way to be invoked at some point in the future, it makes executive   silence become the policy,” he added. ”Because at some point in   the next three and a half years, Trump might decide to invoke it,   thus any executive official can just decide on their own to   refuse to answer questions would turn the privilege into a   permanent executive code of silence because it could be invoked   one day. That is baseless. And absurd.” ’ ’   Shugerman said that, in addition to issuing a written subpoena,   the committee can invite Sessions to provide the answers in a   closed session. The professor added that other committees  —   such   as the Senate Judiciary Committee  —   can subpoena Sessions to give   answers to the same questions. ’ ”   And on top of all that, there is special counsel Robert Mueller’s   investigation. The former FBI director is likely to ask Sessions   similar questions under oath in the course of the probe. That   probe is now likely looking into possible obstruction of justice   on Trump’s part, as Comey’s testimony from a week earlier alluded   to. ” ’   ”So, anyone who thinks Sessions survived and it is over, that   misunderstands how many other steps” there are, Shugerman said.   ”The   are problematic.” ’ ’   Other experts said that Sessions was ”behaving in a way that is   consistent” with the way the executive branch has traditionally   viewed executive privilege, noting that there is a longstanding   dispute between Congress and the executive branch on executive   privilege doctrine. Because Trump had not invoked privilege ahead   of time, officials like Sessions, Coats, and Rogers enter these   hearings ”with a really bad hand,” Andrew Wright, former   associate counsel to President Barack Obama and Vice President Al   Gore, told Business Insider. ’ ’   Wright, now a professor at Savannah Law School, said that   President Ronald Reagan’’s   memo lays out some of what   Sessions was arguing before the committee. In a ”traditional   fight,” Wright said Congress would then subpoena Sessions for the   answers. ’ ’   ”We’’re at the white hot public intensity moment, but none of the   other steps have been taken, right?” Wright said. ”Sessions came   in on a volunteer basis, he hasn’’t been threatened with contempt.   But make no mistake about it, every other dispute in the past,   Congress has been saying you’’ve committed a crime the whole time”   by not answering. ’ ’   Wright, who’’s been on the other side of the aisle in instances   such as the Operation Fast and Furious ordeal and former Attorney   General Eric Holder being subpoenaed by Congress for documents   related to it, said Congress ”needs to enforce its prerogatives   here.” ’ ’   ”If Congress wants this information, by all means, criticize away   about the executive branch not having its act together,” he said.   ”But you’’ve got to subpoena this information, and you’’ve got to   threaten contempt if you don’’t get it. Because otherwise, you’’re   going to let the executive branch away without giving a   legitimate legal position and allowing these witnesses to just   have to suffer through awkwardness but not actually come to   grounds.” ’ ’   But former assistant US Attorney and CNN senior legal analyst   Jeffrey Toobin doubts that the Republicans will see any benefit   in issuing those subpoenas. ’ ’   ”You won’’t have these members going to court to get these   administration officials to testify on these conversations with   the president,” he said on CNN Tuesday night. ”I think that’’s the   end of the matter.” ’ ”There was a lot Jeff Sessions couldn’t quite. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’",

But the island sits 4 feet or so above sea level, and a  suggests that little of it will be left 50 years from now.’ ’President Donald Trump, however, disagrees.  that after Trump saw a CNN report about Tangier Island, the president called Mayor James ”Ooker” Eskridge to tell him he shouldn’t worry about a rise in sea levels.’ ’”He said, ’’Your island has been there for hundreds of years, and I believe your island will be there for hundreds more,’’” Eskridge told The Daily Times.’ ’But Business Insider photographer Christian Storm visited Tangier Island in 2014, and his photos show how serious the problem has become there.’ ’Storm wrote a previous version of this story.’ ”Records indicate that in the   Tangier Island encompassed about 2, 060 acres. It was home to watermelon farms, grazing cows, and a variety of plant life. But since 1850, over 66% of Tangier’s landmass has disappeared underwater.” ’”We have a pretty high degree of certainty that things are going to get wetter and wetter,” Carlton Hershner Jr. a climate change scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science,  in 2013. ”Not to be a bearer of bad news for Tangier, but that would suggest that sometime in the next 50 to 100 years the island would basically be underwater. ”’ ”The island is reachable only by boat  —   it’s an     ferry ride from the coast. That keeps the place mostly closed off from the rest of the world. Some islanders go years without seeing the mainland, getting the supplies from the mail boat that arrives in the harbor every day.” ’But being a waterman is becoming increasingly difficult. In an effort to prevent overfishing, Virginia placed a moratorium on new crabbing licenses, and other restrictions have also reduced the length of fishing seasons.’ ’”You don’’t have to worry about traffic jams and murders, child molesters, rapists, and thieves,” Laird said. ”You can leave your doors open. You don’’t have to lock anything. ”’ ”Laird and other island natives share a thick accent that’s equal parts Southern twang and Irish brogue. Vowels are extended to multiple syllables, making certain words hard to understand for outsiders.” ’”Tangier’’s ” Laird said. ”It’’s a nice place, and everything’’s reasonable here. ”’ ’Today, the Uppards has almost succumbed to the rising water levels, turning into a swampy wetland. Major portions are submerged, reachable only by skiff. A solitary dilapidated mobile trailer on the beach is one of the only signs that humans ever lived there.’ ”Laird recalled playing with his friends in the Uppards and hunting ducks there with his father. But despite the stark scene, he doesn’t seem worried.” ’”The island ain’’t goin’’ nowhere,” Laird said. ”They talk about erosion, but it’’s been here forever, and it ain’’t gone nowhere in forever. ”’ ’Legend has it that John Crockett  —   still a common surname on the island  —   was the first to inhabit Tangier full time when he arrived with his eight sons in 1686.’ ’The island shuts down every Sunday morning and once denied Hollywood filmmakers permission to shoot the   Kevin Costner movie ”Message in a Bottle” there because of the script’’s mentions of swearing, sex, and drinking.’ ’Tangier is dry; booze is unavailable for purchase.’ ’”I’’d like to be able to do this for the rest of my life,” said Laird’’s    son, Nick. ”It’’s kind of scary to think you might not be able to. ”’",
